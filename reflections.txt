Your response goes here!

* So as i started learning web development, i realised its fun to play around, have tried few things on my own.
I have basically learned the process flow, how elemnts are related to each other(parent, child hirerachy), in terms
of language i am getting idea of html(which is totaly new to me), and also the general idea of how wast the scope of 
web development is.

* The video tutorials make it easy to understand the basic concept, plus there is straight away hands on via quizs, so its 
quite good.

* Difficulty i am facing, is regarding understanding the problem instruction more clearly, as i am new to this kind of learning maybe i would overcome this over time.

* In project basically the instructions are given, so you got to undersatnd them properly, also there are hints given where required so i utilised those to. My problem solving skills are improving in regards that i have to understand the problem properly and then do some research on it and then produce the final code.
